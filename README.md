## ðŸ“– About the project
In this project, developed using the Java language, I implemented basic inputs with validations. These inputs result in an output, which is the difference between the 2nd parameter and the 1st parameter, both of which are inputs themselves. <br>
However, if the user enters the 2nd parameter smaller than the 1st, an error occurs, which is handled through a custom function. Nevertheless, this basic challenge is part of a DIO Bootcamp: Santander Bootcamp | Fullstack Developer.
